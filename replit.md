## Data Flow

### Client-Side Data Flow
1. React components use TanStack Query for server state
2. Forms validated with Zod schemas before submission
3. Optimistic updates for better user experience
4. Error boundary handling for graceful failure recovery

### Server-Side Data Flow
1. Express middleware handles authentication and session management
2. Route handlers validate input and interact with Drizzle ORM
3. Database operations return typed results
4. Response formatting with proper HTTP status codes

### Authentication Flow
1. User initiates login through Replit OAuth
2. OpenID Connect validates credentials
3. Session created and stored in PostgreSQL
4. Subsequent requests authenticated via session cookies

## External Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Hot Reload**: Vite dev server with HMR for frontend
- **Backend**: TSX for TypeScript execution with auto-restart
- **Database**: Connection to Neon PostgreSQL development instance

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite production build with optimization
- **Backend**: ESBuild compilation to single bundle
- **Static Assets**: Served by Express with proper caching headers

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: Connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Authentication**: Replit-specific OAuth configuration
- **Sessions**: Secure session secret for production
- **Build Process**: Automated build pipeline for Replit deployment

### Scaling Considerations
- **Database**: Neon's serverless PostgreSQL scales automatically
